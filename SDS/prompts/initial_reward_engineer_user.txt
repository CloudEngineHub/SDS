The Python environment is 

{task_obs_code_string}

You are also provided with the corresponding indices to access each foot contact states where a value greater than 0 indicates contact:
- FL_foot: 4
- FR_foot: 8
- RL_foot: 12
- RR_foot: 16

{sus_string} Lastly, generate a reward function for the demonstrated task by the quadruped. Ensure the reward function accurately captures and incentivizes the completion of the demonstrated task. Additionally, as the policy will be trained in a simulated environment and deployed in the real world, prioritize stability and minimal action rate while ensuring the leg movements stay within their DOF limits.
